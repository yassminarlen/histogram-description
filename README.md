#Defining Histogram
**Histograms show the frequency or relative frequency of the distribution of a single variable.**
1. A histogram is a graph that is used to demonstrate the density of a single variable. 
2. Higher bars represent where the data is more relatively common.
3. The variable that is being measured is always placed on the horizontal axis. The frequency of the variable is always placed on the vertical axis.
